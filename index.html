				<p>Littering is a major problem in Egypt that harms the environment and spoils our streets, it's often caused by people simply not knowing where the nearest bin is. Basket Finder solves this problem by providing users with an interactive map that includes locations of nearby garbage bins. This application was developed using Flutter as the frontend and Firebase as the backend.</p>

				<p>In this project we utilized multiple sensors to create a smart home and a green house, and to control the sensors we used an Arduino UNO. The smart home includes a temperature system that uses a DHT sensor, a security system that uses a PIR sensor to detect movement outside the house, a smart door that only allows entry when the correct password is entered, and a smart lighting system that can be controlled via a mobile application. Next to the smart home, we created a smart garage that automatically opens and closes as the situation requires, this system relies on 2 IR sensors placed inside and outside of the garage. For the green house, we used a DHT sensor to monitor the plantâ€™s temperature and humidity, an LDR sensor to monitor the light levels, and we also used a soil moisture sensor to ensure that the moisture levels of the soil are sufficient. If the soil moisture is low, the water pump starts to pump water into the soil to increase it adequately. All information about the plant is provided on the mobile application.</p>

				<p>A desktop application built with Python and PyQt5 that allows users to analyze text. Text Analyzer provides text analytics functionality through a simple GUI. Users can paste or type text into the main text box area. Buttons are provided to clear the text box or correct any grammar/spelling errors. Key metrics like word count, character count, sentence count, and grade level are calculated and displayed to the user upon text analysis. This gives insights into things like complexity, readability and length of the provided text sample.</p>
